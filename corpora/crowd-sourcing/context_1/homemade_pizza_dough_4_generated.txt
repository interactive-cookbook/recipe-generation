In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine yeast, water, salt, oil and 2 cups flour.
Using the dough hook, mix on 2 speeds for about 1 minute.
Add the remaining flour a half the cup at a time until dough clings to the hook and sides of the bowl are clean.
Continue to wring in mass an additional 2 minutes.
Place the dough in an oil bowl (I often use the bowl I removed then returned to the stand mixer) and turn into the oil bowl on top.
Cover with a towel or plastic wrap.
