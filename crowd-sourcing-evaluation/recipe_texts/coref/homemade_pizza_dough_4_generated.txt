In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine yeast, water, salt, oil and 2 cups flour.
Using the dough hook mix the dough hook on 2 speeds for about 1 minute.
Add the remaining flour to 1/2 cup at a time until the dough hook is clingy and the sides of the bowl are clean.
Continue to wring the dough hook in mass for an additional 2 minutes.
Place the dough (I then return it to the removed stand mixer bowl, I use the dough often ), then turn the dough into a bowl (I use the stand mixer often ), greased with oil.
Cover the dough with towel or plastic wrap.
(This recipe can be divided in four pieces to make a smaller crust tuesday, or two larger crust tuesdays ).
Place the dough in a warm place to rise for an hour.
Make the pizza according to your favorite direction.
