Pull the leaves off the cauliflower and cut out the core in a kind of cone-shaped section.
Break or cut the florets into small, regular pieces (about 1 1/2 inch) and put them in the steamer insert.
Bring about 1 inch of water to a boil in the steamer pot, add the insert, cover, and cook for about 20 minutes, or until you can poke a paring knife into the stems and you can feel that there 's still a little texture there.
Dump about half of the cauliflower into a food processor.
Pour in the nut milk and purée until smooth.
Now dump the rest of the cauliflower on top and purée again.
You 'll need to stop and scrape and stir the purée a few times.
Once smooth, add in the butter, salt, pepper and garlic and mix.
Taste for seasoning and serve hot.
(You can reheat over low heat in the same pan if you 're not eating immediately.).
