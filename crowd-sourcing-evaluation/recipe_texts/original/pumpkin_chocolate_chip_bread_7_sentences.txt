Preheat oven to 350 degrees, and grease a loaf pan.
In a large mixing bowl, add flour, oats, salt, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and baking powder.
Stir to combine.
In another mixing bowl, beat the eggs with an electric hand mixer and then add the sugar.
Beat until well combined.
Add the oil, yogurt, pumpkin, and vanilla and beat to mix well.
Fold the mini chips into the batter.
Pour into the loaf pan and bake for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean.
