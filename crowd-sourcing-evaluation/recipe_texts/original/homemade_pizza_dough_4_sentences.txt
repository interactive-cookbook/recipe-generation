Combine yeast, water, salt, oil, and 2 cups flour in the bowl of a stand mixer.
Using the dough hook, mix on speed 2 for about 1 minute.
Add remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough clings to the hook and cleans the sides of the bowl.
(This should take about 2 minutes).
Continue kneading for an additional two minutes.
Place dough in a greased bowl (I often use the stand mixer bowl, which I remove the dough from, grease, and then return the dough to), turning to grease the top.
Cover with a towel or plastic wrap, and place in a warm place to rise for an hour.
This recipe can be divided into 4 pieces to make smaller, thin crust pizzas, or can be divided in half to make 2 larger, medium-thick crust pizzas.
