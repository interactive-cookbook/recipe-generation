Preheat oven to 350° F.
Lightly grease two 9 x 5-inch loaf pans.
In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat sugar and vegetable oil to blend.
Add in eggs, one at a time, then vanilla, mixing after each addition.
Add in the banana and stir to combine.
In another large bowl, whisk together flours, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder and salt.
Stir flour mixture into banana mixture in 2 or 3 additions until just combined.
Gently fold in blueberries.
Spoon batter evenly into loaf pans, filling about 3/4 of the way to the top of each pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 60 – 70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of a loaf comes out clean.
Cool loaf pans on wire racks for 10 minutes.
Remove loaves from pans, place on racks and cool completely.
