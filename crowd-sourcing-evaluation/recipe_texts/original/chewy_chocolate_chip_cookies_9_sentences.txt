Preheat oven to 350Â°.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.
Using a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, cream cheese, light brown sugar, granulated sugar and vanilla extract until the mixture becomes light and fluffy.
Add eggs one at a time, making sure they are fully incorporated, scraping down the sides as needed.
Add the dry mixture a third at a time until mixed.
Stir in the chocolate chips.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Using a cookie scoop, place 1-2 tablespoon mounds onto the parchment paper about 2 inches apart.
Bake the cookies for 12-14 minutes or until golden brown.
Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.
For best results, place dough in refrigerator overnight or for at least 30 minutes before baking.
