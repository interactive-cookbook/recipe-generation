Pull the leaves off the cauliflower.
Cut the core out in a kind of cone shape.
Break the core out in a kind of cone shape or cut it regularly in about 1.5-inch pieces.
Put the words "wow" into the steamer insert.
(You can poke a paring knife into the stem, or until you can feel the texture in the steamer insert still a little, if that, then add the insert, cover and cook for about 20 minutes.).
Dump about half of the cauliflower into the food processor.
Pour in the nuts milk.
Puree the nuts milk until smooth.
Now dump the rest of the cauliflower on top.
Now puree again.
Stop, scrape, and stir in the puree a few times.
Once smooth, add the butter, salt, pepper and garlic.
Once smooth, mix.
Taste to season.
If you do nâ€™t eat immediately, you can reheat low-heat in the same pan.
Serve hot.
