In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine yeast, water, salt, oil, and 2 cups flour.
Mix on 2 speed for about 1 minute using dough hook.
Add remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time until dough clings to hook and sides of bowl are clean.
Continue wringing at a mass for 2 additional minutes.
Place dough in an oil bowl (I often use the bowl I remove and then return to as a stand mixer) and turn to oil on top.
Cover with towel or plastic wrap.
