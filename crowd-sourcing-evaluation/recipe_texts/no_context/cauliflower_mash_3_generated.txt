Pull the leaves from cauliflower.
Cut the core out in a kind of cone-shaped section.
Break a wok or cut into regular about 1.5 inch pieces.
Put the wows in the steamer insert.
Bring about 1 inch of water to a boil, add the insert, cover and cook for about 20 minutes. You can poke a paring knife through the stem, or until you still can feel a little texture in the steaming pot.
Dump about half of the cauliflower into the food processor.
Pour in the almond milk.
Puree the almond milk until smooth.
Now dump the rest of the cauliflower on top.
Now pure again.
You need to stop, scrape and stir in the pure a few times.
Add butter, salt, pepper and garlic until smooth.
Mix until smooth.
Taste to season.
If you don't eat immediately, you can reheat the low heat in the same pan.
Serve hot.
